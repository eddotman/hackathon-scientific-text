1. Purify commercial multiwalled CNTs (20 to 50 nm in diameter, Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) by refluxing the as-received sample in 10 wt.% nitric acid for 12 h.
2. Collect the acid-treated CNTs by filtration and dry at 120°C for 12 h in vacuum.
3. Disperse 0.1 g CNTs in 25 ml deionized [DI] water by ultrasonic vibration for 2 h. 
4. Add 0.3 g KMnO4 into the above suspension, and stir the mixed solution by a magnetic bar for 2 h.

Materials:
CNTs, nitric acid, water, KMnO4

1. Observe XRD patterns for each powder sample of Pb1−4.75xNd0.5xNi4xZrO3 composition through an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D-8 Advance).
2. Use the radiation source (CuKα) at 1.4 kW to produce the X-rays.
3. Use a wavelength of X-rays of 1.5406 Å. 
4. Record the data between two theta ranges 20° and 80°.

Materials:
Pb1−4.75xNd0.5xNi4xZrO3, Cu

1. Mix the 1:50 mol ratio of tetrabutyltitanate and ethanol.
2. Add a stoichiometric amount of lithium acetate to the mixed solution.
3. Heat the resultant solution at 120 °C in a hot air oven for 3 h to evaporate the remaining solvents.
4. Calcine the dried powder at 850 °C in a muffle furnace for 10 h to form the spinel LTO.

Materials:
tetrabutyltitanate, ethanol, lithium acetate, LTO
--
1. Mix the 80 wt% active material (LTO & GSLTO), 10 wt% PVdF (binder) and 10 wt% carbon block.
2. Use NMP solvent to mix the slurry.
3. Use a doctor blade method to coat the slurry on a copper foil.
4. Heat the coated copper foil at 120 °C for 3 h to remove the excess solvent.

Materials:
LTO, GSLTO, PVdF, carbon, NMP, copper
