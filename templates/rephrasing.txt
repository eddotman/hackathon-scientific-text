Commercial multiwalled CNTs (20 to 50 nm in diameter, Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) were purified by refluxing the as-received sample in 10 wt.% nitric acid for 12 h. The acid-treated CNTs were then collected by filtration and dried at 120°C for 12 h in vacuum. A typical synthesis process of the MnO2/CNT nanocomposite is described as follows. Firstly, 0.1 g CNTs was dispersed in 25 ml deionized [DI] water by ultrasonic vibration for 2 h. Then, 0.3 g KMnO4 was added into the above suspension, and the mixed solution was stirred by a magnetic bar for 2 h.

XRD patterns for each powder sample of Pb1−4.75xNd0.5xNi4xZrO3 composition was observed through an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D-8 Advance). The radiation source (CuKα) was used at 1.4 kW to produce the X-rays. The wavelength of X-rays used was 1.5406 Å. The data was recorded between two theta ranges 20° and 80°.

The 1:50 mol ratio of tetrabutyltitanate and ethanol was mixed and the mixed solution was added with a stoichiometric amount of lithium acetate. Then, the resultant solution was heated at 120 °C in a hot air oven for 3 h to evaporate the remaining solvents. Finally, the dried powder was calcined at 850 °C in a muffle furnace for 10 h to form the spinel LTO.
